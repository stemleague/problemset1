# Crack the Code: Problem Set 1

# Problem: Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

# STEP 1: Clarify your questions and assumptions
# At a first glance at the problem above, what are some questions you have? Remember there are no dumb questions,
# by asking questions it shows your interviewer that you are thinking about the problem and different edge cases
# rather than jumping straight to writing code.
#
# TODO: Write 3 questions you have about the given problem below in the commented section:
#
# Question 1:
# Question 2:
# Question 3:



# STEP 2: Whiteboarding
# Now that you have clarifed your questions, let's go ahead and start brainstorming the different cases we can get
# Our goal is to code up a Python function that reverses a string. What are some test cases we will expect? Let's 
# assume we have wrote reverse_string function. What are some test cases we would expect?
# 
# TODO: Write 5 test cases you expect reverse_string() should output (Ex: reverse_string("hi") --> "ih"). Get 
# creative - what if we get empty string? What about casing of the string?
#
# Test Case 1:
# Test Case 2:
# Test Case 3:
# Test Case 4:
# Test Case 5:
#
#
#
# TODO: Now that we have our test cases, let's write some pseudocode. What is your coding approach? How will you
# make sure that the input string is returned reversed? What logic do you need to include (loop, conditions)?
# Write your Pseudocode in the commented lines below:
# 
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#



# STEP 3: Code it up!
# TODO: Great job, we've made it to the actual coding part of this assignment. Using your above test cases and pseudocode,
# try writing out your solution to the problem. We have included the starter code in Python below for your reference.

def reverse_string(s):






# STEP 4: Testing Your Code
# (OPTIONAL) TODO: Convert your above test cases from Step 2 into actual function calls and run your code to check if your
# function works. We've included an example call below.

print('reverse_string("hi") should return "ih"', reverse_string("hi"))
